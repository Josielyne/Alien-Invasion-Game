# Alien-Invasion-Game
This is a small game coded in C# that simulates Parashooter, except a soldier is shooting aliens coming down from a spaceship and the soldier can be moved with the keyboard. 
In single-handed mode, the user moves the soldier with the right and left arrow keys, and shoots with the up arrow key instead of spacebar. There is also multiplayer, where one
user uses the arrow keys and the other uses the WASD keys.
